# Shopping Cart Application

## Technologies Used
- React
- React Router
- CSS

A shopping cart app utilizing React that is responsive and follows a11y and WCAG guidelines.

### Challenges

Using React Router and maintaining state was a difficulty. It led me into some research regarding Redux and other state management libraries but ultimately this website would not need anything so robust. I settled on lifting the state up and just drilling it through the components that needed it in addition to the useContext hook.

Additionally, I ran into some issues regarding styles that were set in CSS being overridden by programatically set styles in JS. I have documented these oddities and explained the reasoning behind these decisions in the documentation. 

#### Knowledge gained

This project really helped me gain a deeper understanding of state in React and how to manage it more effectively.
